# naive_bayes_algorithm
This model classifies messages into humorous and non humorous . The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/200k-short-texts-for-humor-detection
The model was trained using naive bayes algorithm and was written using object oriented programming(OOP) and other python libraries such as pandas, regular expression, tabulate, matplotlib, random and collections 
This machine learning model uses naive bayes algorithm for supervised learning.
In this model, I used 10% of the data in the dataset to achieve my result.
12,000 rows from the dataset was used for training while 8,000 rows was used for the test.
